Hello! I’m Ming Min, a 1st-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Statistics & Applied Probability ](https://www.pstat.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank”}, [University of California, Santa Barbara], CA.

My research will be focused around **financial mathematics**, including **portfolio optimization**, **derivatives pricing**, **systematic risk** and so on. Recently, I'm working on preparation towards my research. For more details, please check my [curriculum vitae](CV.pdf){:target="_blank"}. 

If you'd like to talk about my research or new project ideas, I'm always available at [m_min@pstat.ucsb.edu](mailto:m_min@pstat.ucsb.edu){:target="_blank"}.

Before joining UCSB, I got my M.S. in Financial Mathematics from [Department of Mathematical Science, Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences){:target="_blank"}, Massachusetts, US at 2018, and received my B.S. degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://english.bupt.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}, Beijing, China.
